# COGS108_Repo
 
This is our Data Science Project for COGS 108. We decided to investigate the popularity behind instant ramen brands and if there are any aspects outside of their flavor that make them comparable to others. After some research and data analysis of a data set with 3000+ obervations, we found that the amount of ramen brands a country produces does not relate to the popularity of those products, and there is no strong corrlation between ramen style and rating.
